It also allows you to visualize the blockchain consensus mechanism in real-time along with other network-specific information, such as the distribution of block producer rewards on the EOS public mainnet and a list of registered entities on the LACChain public-permissioned network. The Antelope Tools is an open-source tool for the EOSIO community to access data, support voting for Block Producers, and fine-tune their infrastructure."

      "paragraph1": "Antelope Tools is a community-driven open-source tool built by blockchain developers who believe transparency is fundamental to operating blockchain networks. We intend to provide a useful and straightforward app to visualize the Block Producers' relevant information to promote transparency and reliability."
    },
    "subtitle2": "Why It's Important?",
    "body2": {
      "paragraph1": "On the EOS network, token holders must vote for Block Producers based on available information. On permissioned networks such as LACChain, the node operators are responsible for the network running smoothly. We believe that monitoring the network is essential to improve and measure node transparency. Antelope Tools's main objective is to help you visualize objective and reliable information about each node and its activity."
