It also allows you to visualize the blockchain consensus mechanism in real-time along with other network-specific information, such as the distribution of block producer rewards on the public {{networkName}} and a list of registered entities on the LACChain public-permissioned network. The Antelope Tools is an open-source tool for the EOSIO community to access data, support voting for Block Producers, and fine-tune their infrastructure."

We intend to provide a useful and straightforward app to visualize the Block Producers' relevant information to promote transparency and reliability."
